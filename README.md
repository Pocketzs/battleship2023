# Battleship

This project will use Ruby to build a command line implementation of the classic game Battleship.
   
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to “sink” the other player’s ships by guessing their coordinates. The game ends when one player’s ships are all hit and “sunk”.
